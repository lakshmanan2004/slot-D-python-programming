# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
n=int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))
L=[]
while True:
    if len(L)==n:
        break
    else:
        num=input("Enter the element: ")
        L.append(num)
print(L)
max_val=max(L)
index_val=L.index(max_val)
print("Index of peak value: ", index_val)
