#9. The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:Season First day Summer March 20 Spring June 21 Fall September 22 winter december 21 Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date that was entered. Note: Enter First three letter for month example: Jan for January, Feb for February and so on....and first letter of the month should be capital
month = input("Input the month (e.g. Jan, Feb etc.): ")
day = int(input("Input the day: "))

if(month=="Mar"and day>19)or(month=="Apr")or(month=="May")or(month=="Jun" and day<21):
    season = 'Summer'
elif(month=="Jun"and day>20)or(month=="Jul")or(month=="Aug")or(month=="Sep" and day<22):
    season = 'Spring'
elif(month=="Sep"and day>21)or(month=="Oct")or(month=="Nov")or(month=="Dec" and day<21):
    season = 'Fall'
