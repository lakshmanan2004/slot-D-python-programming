#3. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number (Easy) Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. Return the answer in an list.
def smaller_numbers_than_current(nums):
    counts = [0] * 101
    for num in nums:
        counts[num] += 1

    for i in range(1, 101):
        counts[i] += counts[i-1]

    res = []
    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            res.append(0)
        else:
            res.append(counts[num-1])
    
    return res

# Take input from the user
nums = list(map(int, input("Enter the numbers (separated by spaces): ").split()))

# Call the function and print the result
result = smaller_numbers_than_current(nums)
print(result)
